# kotlin-tv

Trying to learn how to create [Spring Boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/) services written using the [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) language, I created this tv show service.  
It is not supposed to be something useful or amazing, maybe a showcase of these two technologies working together.
